2. Set database credentials in site/config/database.php if you're using a database.

## Contribution

First, head over to the Issues tab. Check for any open or closed issues relevant to what you're interested in working on. If your contribution involves a significant amount of work or substantial changes to any part of the project, please open an issue first to check that the work is wanted or matches the goals of the project. For more details, please read: [How to properly contribute to open source projects on GitHub](http://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/). 

The best way to get your work merged into the project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project.
2. Clone your fork ( `git clone git@github.com:<username>/Psyche.git` ).
3. Add an `upstream` remote (`git remote add upstream git://github.com/fadion/Psyche.git`).
4. Get the latest changes from upstream (`git pull upstream master`).
5. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix ( `git checkout -b topic-name` ).
6. Make sure that your changes adhere to the current coding conventions used throughout the project - indentation, accurate comments, etc.
7. Update the timestamp at the top of the file. You *MUST* do this.
8. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) or your Pull Request will not be merged into the main project.
9. Push the branch up to your fork ( `git push origin topic-name` ).
10. [Open a Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description. Please mention which browsers you tested in.
